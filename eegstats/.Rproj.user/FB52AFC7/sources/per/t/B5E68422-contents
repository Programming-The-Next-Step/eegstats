#APPLICATIONS OF FOR LOOPS

#1. CREATING A VECTOR

#APPROACH 1: use x[i+1] to define next step in loop as modification of current i
#How do I get from x[i] to x[i+1]
x <- numeric(length = 7) #defining an empty vector with length /
x[1] <- 3 #define first element as starting point
for (i in 1:length(x)){ #over all elements of x {
  x[i+1] <- x[i] +2 } #use x[i+1] to define next step in loop as modification of current i

#Analogously, how do I get from x[i-1] to x[i]?
#define first position x[1] and
x[1] <- 3
for(i in 2:9){
  x[i] <- 2 * x[i-1] } #change x[i-1] to get to x[i]


#APPROACH 2: use (i in 1:n) loop vector definition (1:n) as basis for vector - modify number i, no starting point x[1] required
#How do I get i to respective value /position in vector?
for(i in 1:8)
{
  x[i] <- 2*i + 1 #using i in operation to get to vector
}

#2. GAME OF DICE
#for rolling dice, replace = TRUE required (sonst keins wiederverwenden)
#simulate rolling of two dice
dice1 <- sample(1:6, 1, replace=TRUE) #roll the dice 1
dice2 <- sample(1:6, 1, replace=TRUE) #roll the dice 2
#BETTER:
#the same dice three times or rolling three different dice makes no difference:
dice <- sample(1:6, 2, replace=TRUE) #roll two dice in one simulation

#3. FINDING MAXIMA / MINIMA
maximum <- - Inf #define a baseline for comparison: infinite or -infinite

#4. LOOP OVER VARIABLES
for (thisVariable in names(myData)) { #here the variable is indexed by its label -> HERE DATA FRAME INDEXING USED!
  if (is.numeric(myData[[thisVariable]])) {
    print(mean(myData[[thisVariable]]))
    numberofnumericvariables <- numberofnumericvariables + 1
  }
}


#adding values to an existing vector
#1. Method: use append()
} else if (x[i] == maximum) {
  maximum_vector <- append(maximum_vector,i) #add index of new maximum to existing one
}
#2. Method: use c() to create new vector
pos <- c(pos, i) # if current value is equal to the existing maximum, we add the index of the current }

#3. Method: just create an empty vector beforehand and then index the value for every i
column_maximum[i] <- max(x[,i]) #here i is 1:ncol(x), so it saves maximum of columns in vector

#4. LOOP WITH SUBSET DEFINITION AND OPERATION (MEAN ETC.)
for(i in 1:length(allEyeColors)) {
  mySubset <- subset(myDF, eyeColor == allEyeColors[i]) # Create subset for the 'i'th eyecolor
  thisMean <- mean(mySubset$score) # Calculate mean of score for this subset
  print(paste("The mean score for eyecolor", allEyeColors[i], "is: ", thisMean)) # Paste some text that describes the result and print it
}

#IMPLICIT LOOPS


#Overview Apply family -----
# -apply: matrix
# -sapply: list, returnes a vector of numerics
# -lapply: list, returnes a list of numerics
# -tapply: data.frame -> conditional mean calculation
# -aggregate: similae to tapply -> give a grouping variable and outcome variable (e.g. for conditional means)

#APPLY loops: matrix operation on column / row
#apply for working with matrices usually
#apply is just a general function with apply(X, MARGIN, FUN, ...), here margin is all rows (1) or columns (2)
apply(x, margin, function, function_arguments) #structure of apply loop, margin (1= rows, 2 = columns, function_arguments (e.g, na.rm = TRUE))
apply(x,1,min) #example: get minimum of each row
apply(m, 2, function(x){sum(x > 2)}) # more complex function definition in apply, here: count the column

#other useful functions for matrices /data.frames
colSums(x[, 1:2]) #sums of first two columns
rowSums()
rowMeans()
colMeans(x[, c('Jan', 'Feb')]) #means of first two columns

#tAPPLY loops: data.frame (factor variable ( conditons)
#computes a measure (mean etc..) for each factor variable in a vector.
#tapply automatically applies function to all factors specified in index variable
#in tapply when specifying several indexes / conditions, then use list() as one input argument for index
tapply(X, INDEX, FUN = NULL)# here index is one or more factors of x
tapply(x$prescore[x$age>25], list(x$group[x$age>25],x$sex[x$age>25]), mean) #example: mean prescores of >25 years old in both groups
tapply(mydf$height, list(mydf$eyeCol, mydf$cond), mean) #use list to specify conditions

#lApply loops: elements in list
#lapply works for lists and applies FUN to every single element of the list -> input of the function (i) is every element of
#the list (results)
lapply(results,function(i){i$p.value}) #example: extracts p-value of every element of the list "results" (a list of t-test results)
#possible to apply explicit / separate function specified somewhere else
lapply(mylist, MyFunction)
#function specified in lapply also possible:
head(lapply(myList, function(x) x$statistic)) #here extract t-statistic is function

#sapply
#for list, returnes a vector of numerics
hist(sapply(myList, function(x) x$statistic), main = "Succes!")
#example for sapply and function
out <- sapply(ind, leaveOneOut, data)
leaveOneOut <- function(ind, data) {
  out <- cor(data[-ind,1], data[-ind,2]) # computes correlation without one data point i
  return(out)
}

#aggregate
#specify metric and then all conditional variables to which function should be applied
aggregate(x,by, FUN)
#even if only one variable in by (conditions) -> it has to be put in a list
aggregate(df$Days, list(df$Sex, df$Age), mean) #means of days for sex and age

#Remember when writing loops
#Is operation (subtraction, addition, etc.) actually assigned to the original object to implement operation?
#use != in while loops (for while not)
#in while loop with several conditions, all conditions have to be in separate brackets

#FUNCTIONS ----
# 1. The general form when creating a function
myFunction <- function(x) { #myFunction is name of function, x is input of function -> use value of x here in function(3), then x = 3
  code_body #Insert code to be carried out when calling the function
}

#2. Functions operate in local environment
# functions operate in their local environment and cannot change object in global environment
# new objects defined in loop will not be included in global environment unless there is explcit command to return it
# what is happening in a function stays in the function if it is not returned

#3. Return function
# return function: all outputs should be returned, not printed! return() ends function, arguments after will not be defined!
# to return multiple objects, put them in a list and return one object (the list) / R can only return 1 object
function(x) { return(y) }
# sometimes operation can directly be returned, not always necessary to assign to new object!
myMeanFunction <- function(x) {
  return(sum(x) / length(x)) # directly returns mean, no assignment necessary
}
#return should always be before the last closing curly bracket from function (after for loop brackets!)

#4. Saving objects from inside the loop outside in global environment
erpdata <<- x # use double arrows inside function. Return is simply meant for printing

# in loops, explicit command to print things required
for (i in 1:n) {print(mean(m[,i])) }
# loading a function into the workspace
source("namefunction.R")
# all objects used in function have to be defined
myFunction <- function(x, myTitle) #here both x and myTitle have to be defined in every function cal
myFunctiion(1:5, 'yay!') #here x is 1:5 and myTitle is yay!
# use default specification of
myFunction <- function(x, myTitle = 'defaultTitle') #here x has to be defined in function call
myFunction(1:5) #since default is defined, title takes default title ("defaultTitle) if not further specified
#another example with default in function
hello <- function(hello = TRUE) { if(hello) {
  print("hello") } else {
    print("goodbye") }
}
hello() #no input in function will automatically use default value and print TRUE

# example function to add five to numeric value and computes the mean
myFunction <- function(x) {
  x <- x + 5
  return(mean(x))
}

# Build functions with several steps (conversion) in it
absnew <- function(x)
{
  if(is.logical(x)) #first if: converts logical into numeric, no else statement
  {
    x <- as.numeric(x)
  }
  if(is.numeric(x)) #second if: uses numeric from before
  {
    x[x<0] <- -x[x<0]
    return(x)
  } else
}

# Make function also applicable to strings
myFunction <- function(x) {
  if (is.numeric(x)) {
    x <- x + 5
    return(mean(x))
  } else {
    stop("Please supply a numeric object to this function")
  }
}
myFunction(1:5)
myFunction("a")

# NOT always necessary to define new object, but just return it immediately
add <- function(a,b) {
  return(a+b)
}

#functions with NA removal
add <- function(x, na.rm = TRUE) { #just changing the default in function definition (na.rm = TRUE)
  if(na.rm) {
    x <- x[!is.na(x)]
  }
  for(i in x) {
  ...
  }
# use STOP('error message') function to stop looping in certain conditions
#stop if not numeric
add <- function(x) {
  if(!is.numeric(x)) {
    stop("only numeric values allowed")
  }
  for(i in x) {
    ...
  }
# use WARNING('warning message') to give warning message in certain condition
  if(sum(is.na(x)) > 0) {
    warning("NA values detected")
  }

# TESTS that a function should pass (see lecture)
#check mode -> if numeric required then convert logical into numeric
  if(is.logical(x)){
    x <- as.numeric(x)}
#check mode -> if numeric required then give warning in all
else {cat("Warning: only numeric input allowed\n")
print(x) }


##How to address exam questions
#1. what is the mode of the data to modify?
# If matrix, then possible to use apply instead of complex for loop?

#use functions in APPLY()
apply(m, 2, function(x){sum(x > 2)}) # count the column

#use switch function
switch(expr,
       {body 1},
       {body 2},
       ...)

#ADDING NEW ARGUMENTS TO FUNCTION
#introduce new argument as input of function and specify default (TRUE or FALSE)
function(x, summarize = FALSE)
  #code in function "if argument set TRUE" as:
  if (summarizeFactors) { .... }
#example: Add an argument to the function called `summarizeFactors`. If this argument is set to `TRUE`, then
# your function should print the counts (i.e., frequencies) of factor variables. Default should be false
summaryFun <- function(myDF, summarizeFactors = FALSE) { #introducing new argument to function with default = FALSE
  for (thisVariable in names(myDF)) {
    numberOfFactorVars <- 0
    if (is.factor(myDF[[thisVariable]]) & summarizeFactors) { #if argument TRUE
      print(table(myDF[[thisVariable]]))
    }
  }
  return(numberOfFactorVars)
}
summaryFun(myData, summarizeFactors = TRUE)
}}

#sapply used in function call -> function call within same function
leaveOneOutCor <- function(ind, data){
  if(length(ind)>1){
    out <- sapply(ind, leaveOneOutCor, data) # apply function inside function
  }else{
    out <- cor(data[-ind,1], data[-ind,2]) # applied for every element of list
  }
  return(out)
}



#PLOTTING ----
#use other packages, such as ggplot()
#basic plotting functions (high level)
plot(x)
# depends on the class of the object to plot: t (time series object), M (matrix), and D (data frame) are different classes.
# plot.default always uses default plotting option / plot() always adapts to hidden functions for class of object
boxplot(DV_Y ~ grouping_variable) #shows boxplot for all groups
plot(x) #if x is just a vector, then it will be plotted against indices (1:n)/ number of data points ≈
lines(x) #plots x with lines connecting dots
points(x) # draw a sequence of points at the specified coordinate
pie(x) #draws a pie chart
hist(x) #historgram
stem(x) #produces stem and leaf plot, useful for checking normal distribution
# stem-leaf plot: the tens (e.g., 5|4 denotes 54).
stripchart(x) #one dimensional scatter plots (or dot plots) of the given data
matplot() #Plots the columns of one matrix against the columns of another.

# Two plots in one
# Method 1
plot(a)
par(new = TRUE) #
plot(b)
# Method 2: same parameter as in initial plot
plot(a)
lines(b)

#boxplot
boxplot(x) #gives generic boxplot for all columns in x
boxplot (x[,2] ~ x [,1]) #gives boxplot for model y (x[,2]) ~ x (x[,1])
# Useful parameters in boxplot:
width = 1
notch = T
border = 'blue'

#plot with lines
plot(x, type = "l")
plot(x)
lines(x)

#Barplot
table() #will print a frequency table -> also two variables as input
barplot(table(x)) #possible to turn a frequency table into a barplot
col = c('red', 'green3', 'blue', 'cyan','black' ) #define colors of different bars as vector

#ABLINE()
abline(lm(y~x) #add abline by formulating linear model
abline(linearModel) #adds regression line from linear model to plot
abline(a,b) #for tangent at point (x,y) enter the x coordinate in the linear
#model and see y - value -> then use y-value for a = intercept and determine
#slope by building the derivative of the lm and then entering x - value of the
#tangent point

#Plotting options (low level plotting functions)
rainbow(NumberOfColours) #rainbow colours

#axis
axis(1, at = 1:10) #reset axes, x-axis(1) and at coordinates 1:10

#ticks at axis
axis(2, c(min(y), 0,max(y)), labels = TRUE)

#text
text(x,y, 'text') #specifiy coordinates for text field without vector
text(145,120, 'r = 0.4') #coordinates have to be the ones from the x and y axes

#add lines
lines(density(x)) #add lines of density function (after plot(xyz) - function)

#colors
colors()[1] #for indexing i get number / built-in color names
col = 1 #in graphical functions uses colors from palette()


# 1. loops and plotting
# loop over groups to be plotted
plot(x, type = 'N') #start with blank canvas, set type = N
#then run loop

#loop over conditions
  # first define unique group labels that will be indexed inside loop
  # still (ALWAYS) loop over length of unique group labels
#for i in lenth(allCond)
allCond <- unique(dat$condition) #first define unique / group names

#par is reset as soon as plotting region is cleared
#reset plot with bar.

las #orientation of axis labels (1:4) -> las = 1 (vertical axis labels (e.g. 0.1))
mar #margins c(bottom, top, left, ..)

# all plotting options set with par() will remain for the plotting region, need to reset them!

# 3. Plotting LINEAR MODELS
#adding a regression line within a plot
plot(age,y, ylab = 'y', abline(lm(y~age), col = 'red')) #add regression line to plot in red
linearmodel <- lm (y ~ x) #linear model: with outcome y and predictor x, assigned to object
#oter linear model illustrations
boxplot(y ~ x) #creates scatterplot with x and x
plot(y,x) #just scatterplor with x and y
abline(linearModel) #plots regression line with linear model
summary(linearmodel) #prints important info on linear model
# to get to correlation coefficient, extract the R squared and take squareroots of it
sqrt(summary(lm(y~age))$r.squared)
# if variance is supposed to be 225 then mean = 100 and sd = 15, variance is squared sd

#connecting data points: here x/y and and x/predicted y (links to abline-regression line)
for (i in 1:20) {

  #in loop use segments(x,y,x_2, y_2)
}

#plotting functions
# when f(x) formula given, then define as MyFunction <- function(x)

#density ----
plot(density(rnorm(10)))  #plotting density distributed numbers
# if percent on y-axis then use density

# 4. GRAPHICAL DEVICES
dev.new() #open new graphical device
dev.off() #close new graphical device
# pdf() best version: plots every plot on a separate page
pdf('filename.pdf') # initiated an empty pdf in working directory, everything that follows will be written to pdf file
#anything to print in PDF: plot() #or legends() #will be plotted to pdf
dev.off() #ends plotting -> everything should be plotted to pdf file and end file creation
#alternatives to pdf('filename'): png('filename') or jpeg('filename')
#to plot sth in pdf: pdf('filename') plot(something) dev.off()

# Computing time ----

#Wall time
t1 <- Sys.time() # Record start time
body
t2 <- Sys.time() # Record end time
difftime(t1, t2) # Computing time in wall time

#CPU time
system.time(
  {body}
) # Computing time in CPU time


# DEBUGGING ----
# make short comments
# try out individual parts of code
# never write entire function but always single lines / pieces isolated, in the end: add them together!
# testing:
# debugging syntax erros
  #press control p next to bracket to jump to closing / matching bracket
  #check warnings by R (red marks on the side)
  #check misspellings
# use print() statements in debugging to print values or print('I made it until here')

# ISOLATION
  # 1. comment out function or loop -> run body of code with specific vcalues (isolation)
  # 1. set a specific value for the input / -> specific iteration (i) and see what happens
  # inclue print('I made it this far') to see whether error happened before or after print

# DEBUG FUNCTION
# use debug() function to dive into function environment
# opens new window and allows you to  step through function line by line
# with enter in console
# error will occur at the erroneous line
debug(f) #start debugging
f(1)
undebug(f) #stop debugging -> removes debugging flag

#BROWSER
# use browser() function inside problem function to run code until this point and then start debugging (like with debug)
# build it into a function to start debugging window at this point
myfunction <- function(x) {
  y <- 1:10
  browser() }

#TRACEBACK
traceback() #can be called after you ran your function to see which functions were called by
#your function

#TRY FUNCTION
#build the error in the try('error line') function so the function will give warning and continue as usual
myfunction <- function(x) {
  try(
    stop('this is an error') #should be line that produces error
  )
}

# Advanced Statistics in R ----

#useful statistics functions
t.test #t-test
cor.test() #correlation
lm() #linear model
aov() #anova
library('car') #RM ANova package

#model definition
model <- lm(y ~ x*z) #interaction model (interaction effects), lm() fits model
summary(model) #gives summary of model
plot(model) #then R uses hidden plot.lm function -> various qq plot (for checking assumptions)
predict() #predicts new values based upon model
abline() #plot predicted values vs. observed values -> with abline() plot regression line
anova(model1, model2) #compare both model -> which model fits better (which predictor (combination) is better?)
step(model1, trace = 0) #AIC: stepwise reduction of model and see fit
coefficients(myline) #extracts coefficients

#packages for statistical modelling
aov #good for modelling
ez #allows manual specification of variables
tidyr #useful for converting long-format to short formatz

longdata <- gather(...) #conversion into long format
ezANOVA(data =, dv =, wid =, within = , between =, ...) #define model

#Hierarchical modelling in R: fit different regressions (varying intercepts) per group
library('lme4') #
lmer(..) #standard model definition with (which_coefficient|categorical variable) as argument


#Bayesian Analyses in R
library('bayesfactor')
bf1 = lmBD(iq ~ age, data = ..., progress = FALSE) #bayesian linear model definition
allbf <- c(bf1, bf2, bf3) # all bayes factor of all models
plot(allbf) #plot all bayes factors to see best model (highest bayes factor)
#when comparing models: which model predicted data the best and which variable predicted data best?


# Writing A Package in R ----

# Advice:
  # always check namespace to see what functions have been exported
  # in scripts, don't call library(required package) but call them using requiredpackage::function
  # add required packages in Description under Imports (>= 2.0) for version specification
  # add all functions to one script, not separate scripts: main.r
  # for package documentation: eegstats.r

# starting
devtools::load_all()# load R package, then you can call package

# creation of package
devtools:create('newpackage') # create a new package
# - description file: fill in name, email, description, etc.
# - R folder: contains scripts that do the work in the package
usethis::use_mit_license('eegstats') # Add a license to the package
package:FunctionInPackage # if package is not called then always call functions from package like this
# to update package run both:
devtools::build()
devtools::install()


# Writing a Package
  #' @export # add before functions that should be exported in package. Sometimes helper script should not be exported.
  # put several functions in one script
  debugonce(ReadingIn) # allows to go through function step by step, call function then to go through it line by line


# DOCUMENTATION FUNCTION
# to create documentation: all following commands should be before @export and code!
#' Description: appears below title in section "Description"
#' @param erpdata Data file .... # specifies the "Arguments" section
#' @return #specifies the "Values" section
#' @examples
#' @details For more details, see Wikipedie page: \href{https://www.facebook.com/}
devtools::document() # it will add all exports to namespace, need to build/install again!

# DOCUMENTATION PACKAGE
#' @section Section Description:
#' .......text in section.......
#' \emph{ReadingIn} # explain functions in section

#' @name eegstats
NULL

# Testing a PACKAGE
  usethis::use_testthat()

  # test every function use all of these:
  expect_equal()
  expect_error()
  expect_true()
  # always test only one specific aspect

  # example
      library('eegstats')
      context('Core eegstats functionality')

        x <- matrix(c(2,3,3,4),nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
        ReadingIn(x)
        expect_equal(length(x), length(erpdata))
        expect_error(ReadingIn(c(1,2,3)))
        expect_true(is.matrix(erpdata))
      })



?function # will show documentation






# MORE ADVANCED FUNCTIONS / Coding Style -----
# Write larger programs
  # Start with pseudocode / comments /
  # write subfunctions that are used in functions
  # avoid redundancies (vector 1:3 not c(1:3))
  # write separate functions for computations that are repeated
  # use informative object and file names

# Spacing
  # Use spaces around binary operators (foo(x = 1) and after commas (X[i, ])
  # write short comments

# Functions
  # follow function name with comment section / 1 sentence function description
  # description of arguments
  # desription of return value

# Other advice
  # Avoid unnecessary repeated assignments
  # Avoid using data structures that grow over iterations
  # Initialise data structures (numeric, array)
  # Use vectorisation instead of for-loops
  # Use indexing instead of for-loops

#Vectorization -----
# two vectors: x <- c(), y <- c(), to get elementwise operation use x + y (no loop necessary)
# use ifelse() statement
# pairsum()
# when vectorizing:
  # - try to remove for-loop and turn x[i] into x
  # - try to turn (sm <- sm + x) into sum(x)
  # - look at what is being returned and incorporate this in vector equation (return(1/x) becomes sum(1/x))
# in vector operation: usually vector definition (1:3) always first done then multiplication / operation (1:3*5)

# EXAM PREP -----

#be quick but don't rush

#pay attention to style (in the end)

# other practice  tasks from Assignment 3
#selected ones: (1. Hangman (5 points)), 2. sort (2 points), 13. Infinite Monkeys / Typewriters (2 points) + Prisoners Problem (1 point)
#other interesting ones: t-test, chi-square test (both 2 points),
#instead of hangman: random number generator (2 points)

#plotting exam questions
  #look out for small details
  #determine what elements looks different (axes, plotting symbol, etc.)

#always look for shorter ways to do task (apply function / ifelse, ...)

#start by writing the operations / single steps outside of a loop / function -> then later put everything together
