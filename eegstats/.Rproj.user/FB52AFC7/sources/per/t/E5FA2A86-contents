# eegstats - main script: Ren√©  Freichel. Last updated on 19/05/2020.

# "This script contains several functions that will be the core part of the R package
# eegstats. The first function (grand_average_plot) will plot the mean grand average ERP
# signal over time. The second function allows the user to plot single - subject ERPs.

# Testing
# # For this purpose, we will use the example dataset ERPdata from the package erp.easy.
# library(erp.easy)
# my_erpdata <- ERPdata  # ERPdata from erp.easy will be used
# View(my_erpdata) # subject x stimulus x time x electrodes





















# To-Dos

# 7. cluster based permutation statistics on time - frequency data [still working on it]
