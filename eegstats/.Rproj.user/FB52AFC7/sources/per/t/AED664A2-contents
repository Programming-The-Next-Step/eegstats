## Description

This eegstats package allows the user to analyze and visualize event - related potentials (ERPs) and event - related spectral dynamics (ERSPs). 

## Basic Usage

EEG data is commonly pre-processed and analyzed in Matlab using widely known package, such as "EEGLAB" (Delorme & Makeig, 2004). This package is one of the first that implement EEG analyses in R. To use the eegstats functions, the package assumes the EEG data to be pre-processed. To illustrate the analyses, we could use the ERPdata from the package erp.easy. 
```{r my_erpdata}
my_erpdata <- erp.easy::ERPdata
head(my_erpdata)

```
Typically EEG data is outputted in a long - format shape Subject ID x Condition x Time x Electrodes. 
For ERSP analyses the data is typically in a shape: Subject ID x Condition x Time x Frequency x Electrode. To illustrate the use of the functions, we pretend the existing data file contains time frequency data so all electrodes actually represent frequencies for one electrode. 
```{r my_erspdata}
my_erspdata <- my_erpdata
```

## Individual ERP data
one electrode. 
```{r }
library('eegstats')
```

Sometimes researchers are interested in single subject ERPs to visualize outliers or inspect single-subject trends. First, we compute the single - subject ERP.
```{r ind_average_erp_data}
ind_average_erp_data <- ind_average_erp(my_erpdata, electrode = 7, subject = 'S1')
```

Then, we can visualize it.
```{r ind_average_erp_plot}
ind_average_erp_plot(my_erpdata,ind_average_erp_data)
```

## Grand Average ERP data
We can compute the grand average ERP data.

```{r grand_average_erp}
grand_average_erp_data <- grand_average_erp(my_erpdata, electrode = 7)
```

And visualize it.

```{r grand_average_erp_plot}
grand_average_erp_plot(my_erpdata, grand_average_erp_data)
```

## ERSP: time frequency data 

Compute it.
```{r grand_average_ersp}
grand_average_ersp_data <- grand_average_ersp(my_erspdata)
```

And visualize it.
```{r grand_average_ersp_plot}
grand_average_ersp_plot(my_erpdata, grand_average_ersp_data, n_cond = 1)
```
